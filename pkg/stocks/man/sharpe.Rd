Sharpe Ratio

\description{
Calculate Sharpe ratio based on a vector of gains (or prices). The formula is: (mean(gains) - rf) / sd(gains). Here rf is some risk-free rate of return, and gains is a vector of gains (usually daily, but could be weekly, monthly, or some other time interval). User can specify prices or gains.

# Randomly generate daily stock gains over a 5-year period
stock.gains <- rnorm(251*5, 0.0005, 0.01)

# Calculate Sharpe ratio using risk-free return of 0
sharpe(stock.gains)
