Convert X-year Gain to Average Daily Gain
}
\description{
Converts a proportion gain over one or several years to an average daily gain. For example, an investment that gains 15\% over 3 years has an average daily gain of approximately 0.0186\%. The formula is: daily.gain = (total.gain + 1)^(1 / (251 * years)) - 1. Here total.gain and daily.gain are proportions (e.g. 0.15 for 15\%).
}
\usage{
yearly.daily(total.gain, years = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{total.gain}{
Numeric value (or vector) representing the proportion gain of a security or investment over the number of years specified.
}
  \item{years}{
Number of years.
}

# Calculate average daily gain corresponding to a 15\% gain over a 3-year period 
yearly.daily(total.gain = 0.15, years = 3)

# Figure out daily gain required for various gains over a 5-year period
yearly.daily(total.gain = seq(0, 1, 0.1), years = 5)
