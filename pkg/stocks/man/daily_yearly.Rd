\title{
Convert Daily Gain to X-year Gain
}
\description{
Converts a daily proportion gain to a corresponding annual (or several year) gain. For example, an investment that gains 0.1\% per day would gain approximately 28.5\% in a year (251 trading days). The formula is: total.gain = (1 + daily.gain)^(251 * years) - 1. Here total.gain and daily.gain are proportions (e.g. 0.15 for 15\%).
}
\usage{
daily.yearly(daily.gain, years = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{daily.gain}{
Numeric value (or vector) representing the daily proportion gain of a security or investment.
}
  \item{years}{
Number of years over which you would like to calculate the corresponding total gain. For example, set to 3 if you wish to calculate the 3-year gain for a security that has a daily gain of daily.gain.

# Calculate annual gain for an investment that gains 0.1\% per day
daily.yearly(daily.gain = 0.001)

# Calculate 5-year gains corresponding to various daily gains
daily.yearly(daily.gain = seq(0, 0.01, 0.001), years = 5)
