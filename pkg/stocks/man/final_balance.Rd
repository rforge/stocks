\title{
Calculate Final Balance Based on Initial Balance and Vector of Ratios
}
\description{
Calculated as: initial * prod(ratios)
}
\usage{
final.balance(ratios, initial = 10000)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ratios}{
Numeric vector of ratios between subsequent stock prices (i.e. proportion gains + 1). For example, if a stock gained 3\%, lost 1\%, then lost 2\%, ratios would be c(1.03, 0.99, 0.98). 
}
  \item{initial}{
Initial balance.
}
}
\details{
NA
}
\value{
Numeric vector indicating final balance.
